### MACS 401 Final Project
##Gutenberg-Richer Law Regression
By:Declan Tracy


#Goals: 
To determine whether the earthquakes occuring in the Alaska Subduction Zone area and the Chilean Subduction Zone area follow the Gutenberg-Reicher Law. 

#Motivation:
I am interested in better understanding the frequency that magnitude 9.0 or greater earthquakes occur at, especially in the Alaskan Subduction zone. Additionally, I am interested in how the frequency of megathrust earthquakes compared to the frequency of smaller magnitude earthquakes. 

#Data:
The datasets that I am using are the earthquake data gathered from the USGS Earthquake catelog. I am using the data from the Chilean subduction zone, along with the Alaska Subduction zone. I am using data spanning the time period of 2020 through 2021, and I am using all earthquakes with a magnitude 2 or higher.


#Data Analysis:
I am analyzing this data by graphing the log of the frequency of earthquakes against the magnitude that they occur at. By solving for the best fit line of this data comparison, I will be able to determine the area's Gutenberg-Richer equation constants.
